App Name: SeeFood Client

Explanation:
This zip is organized by the client and server-side code, each contained
in their own source file. The client is written in Java and based around a 
JavaFX interface. All classes and methods are in the one file. We understand
that this is cumbersome, and have done our best to organize and divide the 
code into functions. We ask for your understanding in turn that this is our 
first real experience with designing a consumer application.

Disclaimer: If you intend on running the Netbeans project from Github,
you need to import the .jar files in the httpcomponents folder from
the repository.
